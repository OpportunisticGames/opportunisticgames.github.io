"""Adds new songs to the Soundtrack playlist (goal-machine/music/playlist.json).

Any .mp3 uploaded outside the music folder (and the game's sound effects in fx/) (e.g. to the top of the repo by mistake) is moved into it first. Epidemic
Sound downloads are named 'ES_Title - Artist.mp3', which gives the title and artist; other files use the file name as
the title (fix it by hand in playlist.json). Songs whose file has gone are dropped. Run from the repo root:
    python3 goal-machine/tools/add_songs.py
The 'Add songs' GitHub Action runs it automatically whenever an .mp3 is uploaded."""
