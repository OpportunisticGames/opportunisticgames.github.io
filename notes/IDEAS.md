Ideas for Goal Machine and future games. **Nothing here gets built until we've talked it through and the owner says
go.** Each idea keeps its notes and questions so a later session can pick it up. Status: 💬 to discuss · 🟢 agreed
(ready to build) · 🚧 being built · ✅ shipped · 🧊 parked.

## 🗺️ Priority order (agreed with the owner as we go)

Aim: have a sticky, polished game for the Play closed test (12 testers × 14 days), then launch.

**Done in 4.10:** Target percentages and fairer targets, the Players signed filter, in-app feedback, CHAOS random
formations, and badges round 2.

**Next: medium (a day or two each), a reason to come back**
6. Weekly Premier League quiz, generated from our own data, with a weekly leaderboard
7. ✅ Share your whole day (5.5) *(Claude's idea)*: one post for the group chat with every daily result ("Goal Machine ·
   26 Sep 🟩 Footle 3/8 · ⚽ Daily Ultimate 512 · #️⃣ Grid 7/9 · 🔥 12"), our best free advertising

**Later: big, design first**
8. Money games rework (an AI rival, hidden values, a deadline-day squeeze)
9. ~~Card game~~ shipped as 🃏 Hat-Trick (beta); next: online and a Daily Hat-Trick
10. Manager mode

## 💬 To discuss

### CHAOS moments: make the chaos part of the game, not a pop-up ✅ shipped in 5.4
- **Owner's words (26 Sep):** "The most fun mode but things pop up all at once and it's quite hard to tell what's
  going on… I dont want it to be less fun, but maybe prevent a million things happening at once. Like if my entire
  team's points are getting wiped in half dont just put a tiny notification at the bottom of the screen, have a tornado
  rip through my team… make the chaos moments part of the game rather than just a little add on that gets confusing."
- **Why it's confusing now:** one spin can fire an event (screen flash, 14 emojis, shake), a wildcard storm, the
  CHAOS meter going off 0.7 s later (another flash and toast) and the reels spinning, all at once. The effect itself is
  a line of text above the reels or a toast; the numbers just change.
- **Proposal:**
  1. *One moment at a time.* The spin waits while a moment plays (about 2 s, tap to skip). An event and a storm never
     share a spin, and CHAOS Unleashed waits its turn.
  2. *Every event happens on the pitch:* 🌪️ All In gone wrong = a tornado sweeps the XI and each player's number
     ticks down to half; 🚑 an ambulance to the injured player; 📺 VAR frames the last signing, "checking…", then a
     GOAL / DISALLOWED stamp; 🧾 the taxman pulls a card out of your bag; 💰 coins pour into the score; 🟥 / 🔥 / ⚽
     the next empty slot glows red, fire or gold; 🎁 the box opens and the card flies into the bag; 🎭 masks drop onto
     the reels; 🌪️ a storm turns the reels into cards as it passes.
  3. *Numbers count up or down live*, with a sound for each hit, so you see exactly what changed.
  4. *Active effects as badges* by the score (🔥 ×1.5 ×3, ⚽ ×3 next, 💥 ×2 ×2), not in the small line.
  5. *What happened?* Tap the chaos level for a timeline of every moment in the game.
  Same rules, odds and seeds, so Daily CHAOS and CHAOS Races stay fair and nothing gets less wild.
- **Owner's answers:** go, add new moments; spins are fine, it's the events; the meter should set off the chaos
  (taking or playing wildcards fills it); a couple of seconds each; coin tosses should be real coin tosses; add PL
  managers, each with a consequence; not everything every game, just enough to keep playing.
- **Built (5.4):** 12 managers (perk + catch, 👍/👎 on reels, can be sacked), meter of 4 fed by wildcards and storms
  triggers a big moment (unleash, tornado, lightning, parade, deadline day, sacked); match-day events at 22% with no
  event straight after a big one; storms never share a spin with a moment; coin toss; full-time story.
  Test: `tools/test/chaos.js`.
- **5.4.1 (owner: "TV money twice in one game… add variation, funny things, the more the better, at different
  rarities"):** 20 more match-day events and 3 more big moments, each common / uncommon / rare / legendary (weights
  1 / 0.45 / 0.15 / 0.045, badge on the card), repeats in a game are rare, not banned (owner: "not that it literally can't repeat, just that it's rare"): each time something happens its weight ×1/6, so about 1 game in 35 sees a repeat. The test forces every one.
- **Old questions:** Is about 2 s a moment right (tap to skip)? Keep the same number of events, or also stop two big
  moments landing on back-to-back spins? Any other moments you'd like (e.g. a 🌪️ tornado event that swaps players'
  positions)?

### Money games need more depth (Moneyball, Transfer Window, Auction)
- **Owner's take:** there's something there, but it isn't satisfying. By two-thirds of the way through you're often
  left with one affordable option (a free transfer), and it boils down to "longest career for the cost". It lacks the
  tension of the spin games. It probably needs an opponent (the computer, or a person online) and more depth.
- **Notes:** the fun in the spin games is risk and the unknown. Here everything is known and the budget squeezes out
  choice. Directions to talk through:
  - an AI rival bidding on the same market, who takes players you hesitate on
  - hidden or partly hidden values (a scout report gives a range, not the number)
  - prices that move as the window goes on (deadline-day panic, bargains late)
  - selling: buy low, sell a player back mid-window to fund a star
  - a squad need each round ("you need a CB by round 6")
  - a guaranteed floor so the last picks are still choices, not one free transfer
- **Proposal: "Deadline Day", one transfer game against 3 computer managers** (replaces the three as they are):
  - Everyone starts with a budget and an empty XI; the window runs 8 rounds.
  - Each round a market of 5 players with asking prices. The true value (goals) is hidden: you get a scout report
    as a range ("110–160 goals"), and spend scouting tokens to narrow it.
  - Sealed bids against the rivals, who have personalities (the big spender, the bargain hunter, the panic buyer),
    so the player you hesitate on gets taken.
  - Prices fall as the window goes on, but the good players go first. The last round is Deadline Day: a frenzy.
  - Sell one player back mid-window to fund a star.
  - At the end, a 4-team league table decides the winner (XI totals + a little luck).
  - Online: the same thing with friends in the Auction room.

- **Owner, later:** unsure about the rework. Maybe the problem is goals themselves: make the goal *money*, more
  Monopoly-style? 🧊 Parked for now; come back to it.

### Weekly Premier League trivia quiz
- **Owner's idea:** a weekly quiz.
- **Questions:** questions from our own data (tallies, clubs, seasons), or hand-written about that week's real
  matches? The data-only version can be automatic; topical questions need someone to write them each week (or a
  weekly data refresh that turns into questions). Leaderboard for the week, streaks across weeks?

### International breaks ✅ shipped in 5.6
- **Owner's idea (30 Sep 2026):** "an international break thing… some form of extra gamemode/theme that appears when
  there is an international break", with badges for it and for matchdays.
- **Shipped:** breaks come from the fixture list (11+ free days between PL matchdays in Sep/Oct/Nov/Mar, worked out by
  build_fixtures.py). During one: flag bunting, an INTERNATIONAL BREAK banner on Home and Today, and the International
  XI (#/nations): 32 countries with 10+ PL regulars, drafting from every PL player each has had. New badge list
  "Matchdays & breaks" (6 matchday, 5 international, 3 of them secret).
- **Maybe next:** a daily "International Footle" during breaks; a nations leaderboard (which country's fans score most).

### One difficulty switch ✅ shipped in 5.6
- **Owner (30 Sep 2026):** the "50+ apps / every player" switch on the cards was ugly; fold it into the difficulty.
- **Shipped:** Normal / Hard / Extreme. Extreme = every player in the Main event and CHAOS (the old Extreme/Purist and
  CHAOS Extreme boards). The Main event card keeps Classic/Ultimate and wildcards on/off. Old Hard and Extreme-pool
  settings carry over.

### Your club's matchdays ✅ shipped in 5.5
- **Shipped:** real fixtures (data/fixtures.js, from the FPL API or the FPL repo, rebuilt with the Tuesday data job);
  a MATCHDAY banner on Home and Today; a matchday hub (#/matchday) with the next match and what's coming up; the
  Matchday XI (either side, double for both, seeded by the fixture, one go, a leaderboard per match); a pre-match
  Footle (played for both, or either if hardly anyone did); a 9am "Matchday" notification in the Android app (the app
  sends its next match to app_inbox; a setting, on by default).
- **Maybe next:** a league of the week's Matchday XI scores between rival fans; a post-match "who scored" quiz.
- **Owner's idea (30 Sep 2026):** "it would be cool to have something on your team's matchdays, can't think what
  though."
- **Notes:** needs fixture dates for the favourite club (not in our data yet; a weekly fixtures fetch in the data
  workflow could add them). Ideas to talk through: a matchday banner on home ("🏟️ Everton v Spurs today"); a
  matchday Club XI with double points for players from both clubs; a pre-match Footle using players who played for
  both sides; a push notification on the morning of the game.

### Hidden things: secrets, unlocks, easter eggs ✅ first round shipped in 5.5
- **Owner's idea:** hidden items, unlocks and secrets to keep the game exciting.
- **Notes:** some directions, from light to heavy:
  - secret badges (hidden in the list as "???" until earned): an all-one-club XI, exactly 442 goals, a 0-goal XI
  - easter eggs triggered by real football moments: sign Aguero with the last spin → "AGUEROOOO" commentary
  - unlockable looks: pitch styles, retro kits for the card design, earned rather than bought
  - a hidden mode that appears after something special (e.g. completing a club's full set in the Album)
  - rare "legend" reel cards with a special shine (cosmetic)
- **Questions:** cosmetic only, or can unlocks change gameplay (a new wildcard)? Should secrets be shareable
  ("I found the hidden mode") to spread word of mouth?
- **Owner's ideas (30 Sep 2026):** over half the XI from your club; the Gerrard slip (Gerrard on 0 in CHAOS); CHAOS
  with its own challenges, some secret, and CHAOS as the headline event; an XI of PL lifers; players who got
  relegated; one-season players; a daily banter line about your club on the home page.
- **Shipped in 5.5:** Share my day; CHAOS headline + a CHAOS badge category (Total Anarchy, Vote of No Confidence,
  Once in a Lifetime, Meltdown, Gaffer's Favourites; secret: The Slip, Dilly Ding, Fergie Time, We Are Not Alone,
  Pigeon Fancier); squad badges Proper Fan, Lifers (career spans 10+ seasons; we don't have careers outside the PL),
  Going Down (from a relegation table in collection.js + Transfermarkt club spells, which have gaps); secret Yo-Yo
  Club and One-Season Wonders; the Slip event goes for Gerrard; an AGÜEROOOO moment for signing him last; daily
  club banter (js/banter.js). Test: `tools/test/secrets.js`.

### Manager mode
- **Owner's idea:** some form of manager mode.
- **Questions:** what's the fantasy? Build a squad over a "season" of fixtures, simulate results from squad
  strength, manage a budget and transfers between gameweeks? It's a big feature, so a small first version would help
  work out whether it's fun.

### Optional account recovery (email or Google sign-in) 💬
- **Came up (30 Sep 2026):** filling in Play's Data safety form, the owner asked "we probably should start collecting
  emails right?"
- **Notes:** the one strong reason is recovery: an account lives on the phone (a secret key), so a lost phone with no
  backup loses it. Costs: UK GDPR duties once we hold emails (security, breach reporting, opt-in consent before any
  newsletter), friction at sign-up, and the policy and Data safety form would need updating. Agreed for launch: don't
  collect emails. Later, if lost accounts become a problem, an **optional** "link your email / Google account to
  recover your progress", never required.

### Share your whole day *(Claude's idea)*
- Footle and the drafts already have share buttons. This adds one "Share my day" on the Today page: every daily
  result plus your streak in one spoiler-free post, with the link. One post a day in a group chat is how Wordle
  spread.

### Online lobby / quick match *(step 1, Quick match, ✅ shipped in 5.1)*
- **Idea:** a lobby to play people you don't know yet.
- **What it could be, in steps:**
  1. **Quick match:** tap "Find me a game" for a Live Race (the easiest online game). You join the oldest open
     quick-match game of that kind, or open one that the next person joins. No chat, no browsing strangers. That's
     simple and safe, and it's mostly server work (an `open` flag on rooms and a `quick_match` RPC).
  2. **Open lobby:** a list of open games ("Bob · Draft Duel · goals · 2 min ago") to pick from.
  3. **Live lobby:** see who's online now; needs Supabase Realtime.
- **Things to settle:** only players with a claimed name (and the name filter/reporting we have) can use it; what if
  nobody's around (fall back to a computer opponent after a minute?); a daily cap to stop spam; no messaging at all
  (keeps the Play content rating simple).
- **Hat-Trick online:** ✅ shipped in 5.0 (1 v 1 with computer partners). Next: 2 v 2 with four friends.

## 🟢 Agreed

_None yet._

## ✅ Shipped

- **🃏 Hat-Trick online, 5.0:** you + Skipper v a friend + their Skipper, turn by turn, notifications on your turn.
- **🃏 Hat-Trick (beta), 4.11:** football Spades, 4 players (you + a computer partner v 2 computer rivals).
  Normal shows the numbers (pure Spades), Hard hides them. Each game picks goals, assists or apps. **Next steps to
  discuss:** online (you + computer partner v a friend + computer partner), a Daily Hat-Trick, 2- and 3-player
  cut-throat, harder computer managers, and Nil bids for the computers.
- **4.10 top five:** Target games show a percentage (full time, PB, boards) and targets are fairer (apps 3,400,
  assists 325, from a 20,000-game simulation: a typical random XI has ~478 goals, ~288 assists, ~2,671 apps).
  Players page ✅/❌ filter. In-app feedback (`feedback` table). CHAOS random formations (7 shapes, seeded).
  13 new badges in 6 categories, incl. 6 online and 5 secret ("???") ones. The secret ones are the first step of
  *hidden things*.
- **Settings sub-menus** (4.10): a menu of Account, Look & club, Sound & vibration, Notifications and Gameplay,
  each showing its current value.
- **Version numbers** (4.10): three levels (5.0 big, 4.10 features, 4.10.1 fixes); fix-ups fold into their
  release on the Updates page.
- **Notification choices and reminders** (4.10): owner's spec. Each kind can be switched off in Settings. On by
  default: friend invites and challenges, your move, new game modes, come back (from noon on the 4th day without a
  game, and again after 2 weeks) and an 8pm streak reminder if the streak is about to end. Results are also on. There's
  a daily reminder at a chosen time (off by default). Announce a new mode by adding a row to `announcements`.
