|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-30 | Northern Ireland players showed the Union Jack: there's no emoji flag for Northern Ireland, so the GB code was used | 5.6: a small drawing of the flag the NI football team plays under (the Ulster Banner), everywhere flags show |
| 2026-09-30 | CHAOS: the Double or Nothing / All In coin did a weird shaky glitch instead of flipping. Its keyframes used different transform lists (a scale() only in the middle), so the browser blended them as matrices and the big spin came out as a wobble | 5.5: flipped frame by frame (up, end over end, back down on the right face) with 3D perspective and a shadow |
| 2026-09-27 | CHAOS Lightning strike always halved your top scorer and tripled your lowest, usually a 0, so it was nearly always a pure loss (the sponge and 5000–1 also boosted a 0) | 5.4.2: two random players (the ×3 one has scored); sponge and 5000–1 pick the lowest who has scored, or give bonus points |
| 2026-09-26 | CHAOS: the coin flipped itself (should be yours to flip); moments too quick to read; the event line under the reels overflowed ("ugly"); few sounds | 5.4.1: tap-to-flip coin; three-act moments (full-screen entrance with its own scene, action on the pitch, result); new sounds; tips only on the first go. A CSS filter on the landed coin also flattened its 3D so tails showed a mirrored HEADS: fixed |
| 2026-09-26 | Results spread charts topped out at 800+ (fixed bands), and CHAOS charted goals, not its points (often 800+) | 5.4: every score kept per mode, eight round-sized bands fitted to your range; CHAOS charts points |
| 2026-09-26 | Owner: dailies not refreshing (25th not lit, streak stuck at 1, Moneyball/CHAOS not replayable) | Not a bug: the server shows Daily Moneyball, CHAOS and Ultimate all played on the 26th and nothing on the 25th (last before that the 24th) |
| 2026-09-26 | A friend's phone said "Instant notifications: waiting for Google Play services" and got ~15 notifications at once from the 15-minute check. Only one phone had ever registered for instant pushes; the Firebase token request fails silently and was only retried when the app opened | 5.4 (needs the new app build): the failure reason is saved and shown in Settings, the background check keeps retrying, and more than 3 at once arrive as one summary |
| 2026-09-26 | CHAOS: everything happened at once (event, storm, meter, reels) and the effect was only a line of text | 5.4: CHAOS rebuilt around one moment at a time on the pitch (see the ideas bank) |
| 2026-09-26 | The music sometimes popped when opening or leaving the app: the sound was paused mid-wave (and the soundtrack cut dead) | 5.3: everything fades out before pausing and fades back in on return |
| 2026-09-26 | Quick match had too many choices (3 games × 3 stats), so people waiting could miss each other, and a Draft Duel's fallback said "Play the computer" but started a solo draft | 5.3: one game a day for everyone, always goals; the fallback says "Play on your own" and starts the matching solo mode |
| 2026-09-26 | Online: no way to leave a Live Race once the draft had started, and a Quick match race let you build your XI before anyone joined (a head start that defeats the point of a race) | 5.3: Quick match races wait for an opponent, with "Play on your own instead" after a minute; ✕ on the race bar leaves (cancels an unanswered invite, or ends a race in progress) |
| 2026-09-26 | No background notifications ever arrived (owner + a friend). The 4.9.1 diagnostics showed the cause: SecurityException, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE required for jobs with a connectivity constraint (Android 14+) | 5.2 / app build 25: permission added, with a fallback job without the network condition. **Confirm on the phone:** Settings says "Checking every ~15 min" |
| 2026-09-26 | The ‹ back arrow often didn't work: only the character itself was tappable, and in a Hat-Trick game it pointed at the page you were on | 5.2: a 48 px target, and ‹ to the current page redraws it (Hat-Trick → the menu) |
| 2026-09-26 | Online: an unanswered Draft Duel invite said "your opponent is picking" and "Their's XI"; the invite text was muddled | 4.12: "Waiting for your mate to join", "Their XI", and a clear invite box with the code and Send invite |
| 2026-09-26 | About → The data said there are only 2,039 players, but every PL player (5,157) is in now | 4.10: says everyone who's played in the PL since 1992/93, and that most modes use the 2,039 with 50+ apps |
| 2026-09-26 | Album's sub-tabs (Album / Purist / Players) wrapped onto two lines, and ‹ on Players went to the home screen | 4.10: one line of tabs, also shown on the Players page, and ‹ goes back to where you came from |
| 2026-09-26 | Wildcard cards (e.g. 🩹 Rotation Risk) cut their description off after a few words | 4.10: cards measure themselves and shrink the icon or tag until the text fits |
| 2026-09-26 | The bottom of player cards (the apps line) was cut off on the owner's Pixel (bigger text than the test browser), mostly with two-line names (seen in CHAOS, affected every draft) | 4.10: cards measure themselves; club badges, then the photo size, give way so the stat box always shows. Test: `tools/test/cards.js` |
| 2026-09-26 | The What's New pop-up vanished after about 5 seconds on the first open after an update | 4.10: the new version taking over no longer reloads the page while the pop-up is open, and it only counts as seen once you close it |
